"""
This is a datatype used to store more than one value in one variable name,
in terms of 'key value pairs' (KVP).
Dictionary items  are in brackets {} in "key":2value" pairs, and are
separated with a comma. ie: {"k1":"v1", "k2":"v2"}
KVP are not sequenced, nor are they indexed, rather, they are mapped to each other
